* ✅ Launch Planning

All analysis was performed in **Google Colab**, with visualizations created using *Pandas, Matplotlib,* and *Seaborn*.

## **Project Objectives**

1. Compare Movies vs TV Shows on Netflix
2. Identify most popular genres & countries
3. Analyze yearly trends in content releases
4. Explore user targeting via rating categories
5. Identify top actors, directors & genre pairs
6. Study engagement through durations & seasons
7. Understand content availability across countries
8. Recommend the best time to launch content
9. Generate actionable business recommendations
